# Meditation app
Meditation app <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMBXdZzYqEk&list=PLDyQo7g0_nsXlSfuoBpG5Fgz0Qe3IvWnA&index=10">tutorial</a> using vanilla JavaScript

It is an app that required a lot of css styling.  The app went from looking like this:

To this:

The app plays the sound of rain of the beach while you meditate.  You can choose to meditate for two, five or 10minutes.  

I have finished the tutorial but the app has a bug:

- Selecting the two, five or 10minute buttons does not work

## My approach to fixing the bug
I will look at the code and write comments over each function to fully understand what it is doing.
